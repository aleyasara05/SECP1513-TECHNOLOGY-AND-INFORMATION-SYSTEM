# ASSIGNMENT 1: UTM DIGITAL OPEN DAY

On the 28th and 29th of October 2025, I had the opportunity to attend the UTM DigitalOpen Day with my classmates. The event was well organised and created 
a lively and welcoming atmosphere. From the moment we arrived, it was clear that a lot of effort had been put into making the experience engaging. The staff 
were friendly, approachable, and even gave us souvenirs, which made the visit more enjoyable.

Throughout the two-day visit, we attended several informative talks and explored various booths. Each session provided valuable insights into the digital field and
helped broaden my understanding  of how technology is applied in real-world environments. One of the talks focused on Information Systems, where the speaker shared details
about UTM Digital services, their implementation, and development. Topics such as blockchain technology, UI/UX design, and artificial intelligence were also introduced, 
allowing us to understand current digital trends.

Another talk on Digital Infrastructure exposed us to the UTM Data Centre and explained the importance of digital transformation and infrastructure in supporting organisational 
operations.  We also attended a talk on Data Engineering, which highlighted its role, future prospects, and essential skills needed in the industry. This session helped me realise
the growing importance of data in decision-making and system development.

In addition, the System Development talk discussed software development processes, project management, and the agile methodology. The speaker shared practical examples that helped us
understand how systems are developed in professional environments.

Besides the talks, we visited booths hosted by various companies and departments. These booths showcased how digital technologies are integrated into functional systems used in daily life.
We also had the opportunity to interview staff members, who shared their experiences and advice about working in the digital industry. Overall, the UTM Digital Open Day was a meaningful
and inspiring experience that increased my interest in the digital field.
